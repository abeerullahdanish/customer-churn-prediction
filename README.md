 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Telco Dataset

This is a data science project focused on predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer dataset. The goal is to analyze key customer attributes and build machine learning models that classify whether a customer is likely to leave the company.

---

 🎯 Objective

- Identify patterns in customer behavior that lead to churn.
- Build predictive models using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers.
- Provide business insights to help reduce customer attrition.

---

📁 Dataset

- Dataset used: Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Contains 7,043 records and 21 features.
